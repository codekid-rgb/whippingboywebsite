    <h1>Jemmy's letter to the King</h1>
    <p>
      Dear King,
      
       I would like it if you try to tell royal households from
      keeping whipping boys. When a whipping boy gets whipped the Prince does
      not get hurt so he does not learn the lesson and does it again! I say that
      you should whip the Prince if he is the one who does the bad thing. Also,
      the Prince has learned a lot. I do not think that the Prince needs a
      whipping boy.
      
       From Jemmy.
