    <h1>JEMMY</h1>
    <p>
      He is a smart boy who wants to get out of the royal castle. He is a good
      protagonist because he is smart and brave. He is very good at his job. He
      never screams or howls when he is whipped and this makes the Prince mad.
      You can tell that he does this on purpose! He learns all the Princeâ€™s
      lessons while he is standing by.
