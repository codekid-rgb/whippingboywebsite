  <h1>Why does Jemmy not leave the Prince?</h1>
  <p>
Question 6




		Jemmy does not leave the Prince because he feels bad for him and does not want to be responsible for the Prince’s loss. It shows that Jemmy is caring. I would stay with the Prince if I were in Jemmy’s shoes because I would not like to abandon anyone!</p>
