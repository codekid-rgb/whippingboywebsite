    <h1>
      Prince Brat and Jemmy(The whipping boy) at the beginning of the story
    </h1>

    <p>
      JEMMY is smart, brave, and he is very resilient. He lived in the sewers
      before the King chose him to be the Prince’s whipping boy. Jemmy knows the
      sewers from top to bottom and he can hide and catch rats in the sewer. He
      is not afraid when they get caught by Hold-Your-Nose-billy and cutwater
      but Prince Brat tells cutwater where Jemmy is hiding. PRINCE BRAT is very
      dumb, meek, and he can’t stand a piece of bread with herring. He is very
      spoiled. Prince Brat loves getting Jemmy whipped for all the bad things
      that he does, and Brat does a lot of bad things. He grew up in the castle
      and is used to giant feasts. He is never whipped so he is very bad.
